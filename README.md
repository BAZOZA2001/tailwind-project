This project is a final challenge to build a modern, fully responsive landing page using Tailwind CSS. It demonstrates all the concepts learned throughout the week, including utility-first styling and responsive design. The landing page features a clean navbar, an engaging hero section with a call-to-action button, a structured grid layout to showcase features, and a sleek footer â€” all styled using Tailwind CSS to ensure a smooth and professional look across devices.
